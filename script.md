## Maj script

Maj script is a cursive alphabet with letters from Georgian, Greek and Latin. This is a secondary alphabet that can only be written by hand. We have no font for Maj script and you can not use it with a keyboard. It is designed only for pen.

* Maj letters are continuous, single stroke;
* Maj script is for writing with stylus on a tablet;
* Maj script is mapped almost 1:1 with Lating alphabet;

## Writing Maj

To write a Maj letter correctly you must follow your instinct. Some letters have loops and some have full stops with returns. The return is back over the line, or slightly off forming a sharp angle. Never lift your pen until you finish the letter.

**notes:**
In the previous picture I have used a tablet but you can write with a pencil or with a ballpen on paper. Maj is not designed for paint brush. Each person can customize its own style. However you should be consistent. Do the letter in the same way every time. 

Never rush when you write using Maj Script. If you need to write fast then you use a keyboard and you use Latin alphanet. Maj script is only for heandwriting therefore you can not be fast. Take your time an enjoy some heand work.

## Using Maj script

Maj script can be used to write Romanian. You can use Maj script to write secret messages in any language that can be reduced to Maj alphabet. Next is an example of poetry in Romanian written with with Maj rules and Maj script. I guess a Romanian will understend this text and be able to learn from it the Maj alphabet and the Maj phonetic rules.

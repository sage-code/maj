## Lexicon

Maj lexicon is a collection of several spreedshits that we use to create words and expressions with translation in several languages: Spansih, French, Italian, German, Romanian, Latin. This makes Maj a glue language tat can be used to make polyglot translations between these languages. However Maj do not use gender for pronouns, so the translation of pronoun is not deterministic.

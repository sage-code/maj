<h1>Maj Numerals</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
Maj numerals are associated with old Arabic symbols: We use a particular rule to create numeral words. Each primitive numeral is only 2 characters long. We can add "o" for making ordinals. One numer: ro = 0 has a sinonim: ni = null for nothing, not even 0.
</div>

<h2>Words</h2>

<p>These 3 words are related to counting. We can use them to announce there is a number, for example: noba una = number one. As you probably remember, last vowel: "a" is for noun, "o" is adjective and "u" is for verb.</p>

<ul>
<li>noba = number</li> 
<li>nobu = to count</li> 
<li>nobo = counted</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Digits</h2>

<p>Though there are only 10 digits, in table below we have 11 words. One is for number 10 that is created from two digits: 1 + 0. Correct is: undie but we need a short form of undie = die = 10. So, let's learn how to count in Maj from 0 to 10:</p>

</div>

<h2>Ordinals</h2>

<p>On a list we can refer to the position of one element using ordinals. These are primitive numbers ending with "o". Ordinals require article "al" before the number. Ordinals represent a relative relation between elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>al uno = first </li>
<li>al beo = second</li>
<li>al reo = third </li>
<li>al vio = forth </li>
</ul>

<h2>Repetition</h2>

<p>In many propositions we may refer to a repetitive action. In Maj we use word "ora" that represents how many times an action or event occurs. We use short version of numbers for expressing repetitions. We use to replace the last missing letter from prefix.</p>

<ul>
<li>ni ora = never </li>
<li>un ora = one time</li>
<li>be ore = two times</li>
<li>re ore = three times</li>
<li>vi ore = four times</li>
<li>di ore = then times</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next numbers</h2>

<p>For numbers > 10 we have a simple rule: use prefix "di" and create a composite word. It is very easy to remember. All numbers > 10 are words having 5 letters. We use dash to join prefix "di" with the last number.<p>

  <p>Next Numbers</p>
</div>


<h2>Large numbers</h2>

<p>For large numbers we use short version of digit, and replace last letter with suffix -die that means 10. Practicly we cound how many groups of 10 we have. This method is used to create numbers from 10 to 90 using ration 10.<p>

</div>

<h2>Huge numbers</h2>

<p>For very large numbers Maj has specific names. Each name can be multiplied with a small number to create a huge number. This method is useful to read very large numbers. We have number up to "bila" that is one billion<p>

  <img src="img/huge-numbers.svg" alt="Huge Numbers" width="500" class="img-fluid protect" >

</div>

<h2>Composite numbers</h2>

<p>Now we can read any composite number that is not present in previous tables by using rules. Let's do some exercises then we will explain the rules. Let's start with numbers > 10 that have additional units:</p>

<ul>
<li>21 = bedi ci un</li>
<li>53 = fadi ci re</li>
<li>95 = nadi ci fa </li>
</ul>

<p><b>First rule: </b>Numbers > 20 that have additional units are connected using preposition: "ci" read as /Êƒi/ = and. This word has rol of addition (+). You could use word: "pluma" instead of "ci" to be more precise, though correct is very unusual to use word "pluma" for numbers.</p>

<ul>
<li>421 = vi sute bedi ci un</li>
<li>653 = ze sute fadi ci re</li>
<li>895 = ok sute nadi ci fa</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Second rule: </b>For numbers > 100, the number of times x = "orica" = times is also synonym for "ore" (times). But we do not say "ore" nor "orica" for reading large numbers. Let's learn from examples:</p>


<ul>
<li>1653 = un toza ze sute fadi ci re</li>
<li>3421 = re toze vi sute bedi ci un</li>
<li>7895 = ce toze ok sute nadi ci fa </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Third rule: </b>For large numbers: is not required to use "ci" to separate the large numbers from the small number. That is we do not use "ci" after words: sute, toze, mega, bile. We use ci only for last digit representing units.</p>

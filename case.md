# use case

Maj is an artificial langauge created for an utopic virtual world. Maj is not a good language until we find an useful role for it. I hope my next arguments are sound and will entice you to learn a thing or two about this great language.

## facts:

* Erosion of linguistic diversity has reduced the number of spoken languages to around 6,500;
* Spoken languages become more complex as time pass and therefore difficult to learn;
* Spoken languages are difficult to optimize due to government intervention and culture;
* We learn languages in schools then use them during our lives without questioning anything;
* National language progress is incremental and slow, lagging behind scientific and technologic descoveries.

## Time to learn

For learning English you spend about 5 years in school, from 1'st grade to 5'th grade to learn about 1400 words. The rest of your life you learn English but not all of it. Even if you are born as US or English citizen you will never know all English words until you die. Some people will understend and use specific words based on domain of activity. I have selected about 2020 most frequent English words to be translated into Maj.

For learning Romanian you spend about 3 years in school. A Romanian child will know about 2000 words in this time. Romanian language has better spellig rules but it has a problem. Many children can not pronounce trilled "r" and therefore will use "l" instead for a long time. Usualli this defect in speach disapear in first or second class. Some children though will never make it trhrou wnd will have a speach defect making "r" sound like American "r". Same children have no trable speaking English.

Once is done done, Maj should be easy to learn in less then one year. For this it needs good references translated in many other languages. Our Lexicon is translated in 5 languages: Romanian, Italian, French, Spanish and German. The Latin translation is partial.

## Romanian influence

Romanian is a balcanic language. It has inherited ancient words from Tracian, Bulgarian and Turkish, German and French. For example word "șpiț" = "top" comes from German "spitze". Though Romanian could have import more words from different neighbour languages it is still the most conservaitive Romance language sticking with the Latin heritage.

Romanian language is a complex language. It is suitable for poetry and songs and has many redundant words, synonims and expressions not common in other Romance languages but inherited from Dacian culture. Romanian use to have a Kirillik alphabet but it was reformed. 

Now the Romanian alphabet is using 25 Latin letters and these 5 more:  { Î î Ă ă Â â Ș ș Ț ț }. In total it has 30 letters. I think these letters makes Romanian language more coloreful than English but harder to write and more difficult to comprehend as a secondary language. 

## About Maj:

Maj is inspired from Romanian my native language but does not sound like Romanian. It is much more simpler. Though you could use Maj alphabet to write Romanian correctly I do not advice anybody to do so. Maj will sound a little bit like Portugese maybe.

**key features:**

* Maj is an open source, Romance language;
* Maj is using Latin alphabet similar to Romanian alphabet;
* Maj is limited in scope and you can learn it all in one year;

**punctuation:**

in this document I will use Maj pnctuation style:

* sentences start with lowercase letters;
* names start with capital letters;
* informative propositions end with ;
* imperative propositions end with !
* interrogative propositions end with ?
* enumerations start with star (*)

# Reasons

there are some good reasons to make a new and different language:

**as a project:**

* study grammar and vocabulary of other languages;
* experiment with different words and sounds;
* making demo software for language processing;

**as a product:**

once the language is established it could be usable for:

* SF stories and world building;
* friendly chat;
* making comments;
* outdoor activity;
* taking notes;
* video games;
* artificial reasoning;
* knowledge repository;

the last _use-case_ is actually the most valuable of all;

# maj world

Maj world is a future world where the people speack many languages. Maj is not spoken at all on Earth but only in space. It is the preffered language on Marth and diverse moons that are colonized. Long distant travelers and deep space population is using Maj to send messages and communicate.

Maj is a quiet language without accents. It can be spoken by humans but usually people are using it for writing messages and making voice commands. Long space voiages are lonely and requires efficient communication over longer distances using text messages. Ship computers and stations also preffer to speack Maj.

Maj can be used on chat; it has specifics for describing computer languages and algorithms. therefore Maj is a descriptive _pseudo-code_ and _domain specific_ language used for space travel; Innitially Maj was developped for computers as a back-end language. However humans have learned this language to communicate with the computer without using an intermediary language. The language has evolved and is also used by humans to talk with each other.

Maj can be spoken on Earth too but nobody will understand you; especially if you are in China, Russia or Africa, but if you are on America or Europe some words could sound familiar. Many space travelers return to Earth for retirement. Unfortunately they have to accomodate earth gravity and learn how to sepack Euro that is a similar language to Maj. 

Euro is an aristochratic advanced natural language spoken in Europe. It has a revolutionary grammar and is considered a supperior language. Maj is a vulgar language considered a jargon spoken by workers in space. People who do not speack anything else but Maj are considered primitive, inferiors and badly  educated.

## design:

Maj have shorte words to reduce cost of typing; so Maj can be faster and more efficient than other languages; after initial calculation we estimate Maj is on average 20% more efficient than other languages. Also we try to make Maj more efficient by reducing number of words required in sentances; therefore Maj has an unusually large number of verbs.

in other languages, some writers are using abbreviations; in Maj all the words are already abbreviated; further abbreviation makes no sense; foreign words can be used in Maj but must be enclosed with double quotes FRA:"française" is pronounced: /fʁɑ̃.sɛz/ for example. 

* Maj re-purpose some letters: { h, c, x };
* Maj do not use cedilla letters like: French and Romanian does;
* Maj is using simple grammar rules to reduce complexity;
* Maj has a reduced numbers of sounds, easy to produce;
* Maj will have a reduced vocabulary, less then 5000 words;

**rules:**

* Maj can use prefixes and suffixes to make a new word from a root;
* Maj is using dash `-` to connect with the root word with suffix or prefix;
* Maj avoid synonyms and is using mostly a single meaning for each word;
* Maj frequent words are shorter while less frequent words are longer;
* Maj words can differ from one to other by a single letter;

# but why

a constructed language can have good _use-cases_.

* Maj is using an experimental Script writing;
* Maj ideas can be used for some other languages;
* Maj can be used to learn other Romantic languages;
* Maj can be used to comment software source code;

**for Internet**

Maj is for Internet; it is for software developers from diverse countries to be able to work together in a larger team, even if they do not know English; Maj enable communities of exceptional persons to improve themselves;

**for Peace**

Maj is a language of peace; while you learn this language you also learn peace; the language is used to create ideas of serenity and purity; this will influence you in a good way making you a better person;

**for Making**

Maj will enable you to make new text; this reduce time to write a story or a thesis; multiply this with millions and you can change the world; so writers as well as readers will reduce time to communicate;

it is true that text do not take much space, but in the future AI will learn how to produce text; in this case, the repository knowledge will grow exponential; improving efficiency should be always a goal;

sorter words is the key for better text alignment. as you know full justified text require extra spaces between words. this is more suitable for Maj since it uses short words. The longest words will be maximum 7 characters long.

Maj is a descriptive language; a Maj interpretor can read _Maj_ and do computations to calculate values; using functions and expressions; you can describe _input/output_ forms, _data tables_, _expressions_ and _algorithms_;

it is time to stop talking and start making;
